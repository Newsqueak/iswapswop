using DNSPOD: refer to [www.dnspod.com](http://www.dnspod.com) to choose the DNS routing path of your location.At first, you should determine the default route, and then your region line. The results are as many of A/CName records as you want.

Last but not the least, you need to change the "Nameservers" to such ones:

  A.DNSPOD.COM

  B.DNSPOD.COM

  C.DNSPOD.COM

on the page of your domain name's backend in its registry website.
